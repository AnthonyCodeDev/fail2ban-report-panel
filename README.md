# fail2ban-report-panel

A modern, sleek terminal dashboard for monitoring Fail2ban's SSH jail status. This repository contains a Bash script that displays a comprehensive Fail2ban report, including a summary table of banned IPs, attempt counts, and detailed log entriesâ€”all styled in a clean, uniform blue theme reminiscent of high-end panels.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Displays current banned IPs and total bans from Fail2ban.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Shows a summary table with each IP's attempt count, first and last failed attempt dates.
- **Log Insights:** Provides additional details by listing the 5 most recent log entries for each banned IP.
- **Modern Aesthetics:** Clean blue-themed output for a professional and user-friendly terminal experience.
- **Easy Integration:** Automatically runs on login when placed in `/etc/profile.d/` for quick monitoring.

## Usage

1. Copy the script into `/etc/profile.d/fail2ban_status.sh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/fail2ban_status.sh

## Additional Usage Options

For those who prefer an automatic display at every login, placing the script in /etc/profile.d/ is recommended. However, the choice of execution is entirely flexible: you may run it manually, integrate it into another startup mechanism, or execute it in any context that best suits your workflow. This adaptability allows you to tailor the script's behavior to your specific needs.
